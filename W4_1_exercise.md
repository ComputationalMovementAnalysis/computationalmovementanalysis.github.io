# Exercise 4


**Learning Outcomes***

- You are able to conceptualize a simple movement pattern and implement data structures and corresponding procedures (let's call them algorithms...) for detecting it using R.
- You understand the sensitivity of movement patterns to pattern parameter thresholds.


**Prerequisites***
