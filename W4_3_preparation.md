## Preparation


Create a new RStudio Project and a new Github Repo for this week's exercises. Do this either the simple way we used in Exercise 2 ([Step 3](#create-github-repo) and then [Step 4](#w2-project)) or the more sophisticated way we suggested in [Exercise 3](#w3-preparation).

If you want to publish your Report as a website (to share with others), activate Github Pages by going to your repo on Github, clicking on *Settings > Pages*, and under *Source* switch from *None* to your Main branch. **You can do this only after pushing your first commit**.
